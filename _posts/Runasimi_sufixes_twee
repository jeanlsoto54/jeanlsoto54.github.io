#Runasimi Sufixes

In this article i'll try to explain the runasimi grammatical structure. One of the cornerstones of this language are the prefixes, as so this language is particular because is an
agglutinant dialect. The prefixes have an important role into the understanding of the meaning of the sentences as they can represent the nouns, posetions, indicators of the past or
the future and so on.

+ For example the next sentence: %Runasimiqa sumaq simim% have the meaning of 'Certainly, the language of quechua is truly beautiful'
In this sentence appears two prefixes: '-Qa' and 'M'. The first prefix help us locate what is the principal subject or object being specified in the sentence: 'Runasimi(quechua).
The next prefix, 'M', indicates that the messenger of the sentence is really confident that the message provided is true.

Table of sufixes:

{-Chu} : Sufix of interrogation (with a Boolean logic; yes or no questions)
{-Qa}: Sufix that indicates where is located the subject
{-Pi}: Sufix used for open questions
{-Ta}: Sufix that helps that one element connects with the principal object
{-Manta}: Sufix that shows the origin(location) of the word connected to it
{May}: If we translate this word the meaning would be: Where?
