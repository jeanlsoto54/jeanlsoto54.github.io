Precision Ag with Jonathan Zettler of Fieldwalker Agronomy:

Two types of clients: The ones who wants to put a focus on the field and the clients who have diverse activities who wants that another people take care of the field.

Things that are not in control: the water (because of the weather rain) and the soil an its composition.
However, the thing you can control is the moisture

How to achieve the agtech?
First, you have to collect data in order to discover if there is variability which will lead you to arrange the firdt steps in the agtech.
 And then, invest in the proper equipment
 
 Some tools that help the control:
 view tools, that help to check how is it going the field. However, for the agronomer it is important the field history so you have to gather data.
 free test? so it can be helpful to gather data from different fields, and know ehen the spread the pesticide, when they enrich the soil and so on.
 It is important to include weather tools. Helps to recognize wich bugs and diseases are in the area.
 
 Opportunies for business:
 
 Fertility planning: today's planning comes from the excel spreedsheet. It should be a more agile tool to manage this activity.
 
 Can the agronomist can be replaced?
 Increase the eficiency of the studies. There are activities the the agronomist is doing manually today as calculate formulas on the excel, print some reports or gather data.
 The agronomist are willing to pay for a tool than can automate these tasks.
 Even the tech can calculate the indices more precisely. Still it is needed the work from the agronomist, in the way of giving the tasks to overcome the issues of the field.


[Tech-Enabled Advisor Series] Drone Technology with Todd Vagts of Bayer Crop Science:

UAV Drone can be used to create analytics that are powerful to check the field
It has a advantage compared to the satellites when talking of the influence of the weather on the precision of the photograpies that are taken.
